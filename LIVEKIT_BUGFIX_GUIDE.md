# 🐛 LiveKit "Room Does Not Exist" Bug Fix

## 🚨 Critical Bug Identified and Fixed

### **Problem:**
- Database records created for LiveKit rooms
- **But rooms were NOT created on the actual LiveKit server**
- Result: "requested room does not exist" error when trying to join

### **Root Cause:**
`LiveKitRoomManager.createRoomForSession()` only created database records without making API calls to the LiveKit server to actually create the room.

### **Solution Implemented:**
Modified room creation flow to:
1. **Create room on LiveKit server FIRST** (via RoomServiceClient API)
2. Store LiveKit server-assigned SID in database
3. If database insert fails, automatically delete LiveKit room (prevent orphans)
4. Comprehensive error logging with fail-loud behavior

---

## 📦 What Was Changed

### File Modified:
- `lib/livekit/room-manager.ts`

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Import `RoomServiceClient` from `livekit-server-sdk`
2. ✅ Add `getRoomServiceClient()` helper method
3. ✅ Call `roomService.createRoom()` BEFORE database insert
4. ✅ Store LiveKit `sid` in `room_sid` column
5. ✅ Add cleanup logic if database insert fails
6. ✅ Enhanced logging with detailed error messages

### New Scripts Created:
1. `scripts/test-livekit-connection.ts` - Test LiveKit server connectivity
2. `scripts/fix-existing-rooms.ts` - Repair broken rooms from before the fix

---

## 🔧 Immediate Actions Required

### Step 1: Test LiveKit Server Connection

```bash
cd C:\Users\Raf\Desktop\Projects\YM\young-minds-landing-page
tsx scripts/test-livekit-connection.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Successfully connected to LiveKit server
✅ Test room created successfully!
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED
```

**If this fails**, the LiveKit server is not accessible. Check:
- LiveKit server is running: `ssh ubuntu@140.245.251.150 "sudo systemctl status livekit"`
- Firewall allows connections
- Environment variables are correct

---

### Step 2: Fix Existing Broken Rooms

The session you tried (`44fa27d7-0528-46ce-9648-810539c2555c`) has a database record but no LiveKit server room. Run this script to fix it:

```bash
tsx scripts/fix-existing-rooms.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Found 1 rooms in 'pending' status to check
🔨 Creating missing room: session-44fa27d7-0528-46ce-9648-810539c2555c
✅ Fixed room: session-44fa27d7-0528-46ce-9648-810539c2555c (SID: RM_xxx)

✅ Repair complete: 1 rooms fixed, 0 errors
```

---

### Step 3: Test the Fixed Room

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/meeting/44fa27d7-0528-46ce-9648-810539c2555c`
2. Room should now load successfully
3. You should see the pre-join lobby (camera/mic preview)
4. Click "Join Meeting"
5. Video call should connect successfully

---

### Step 4: Create a New Test Booking

To verify the fix works for new bookings:

1. Create a new booking through your app
2. Check server logs for:
   ```
   📹 Creating room on LiveKit server: session-{uuid}
   ✅ LiveKit server room created: session-{uuid} (SID: RM_xxx)
   ✅ LiveKit room created: session-{uuid} ({db-id}) for session {uuid}
   ```
3. Navigate to the meeting URL
4. Should work perfectly

---

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After running the fix scripts:

### ✅ Database Check:
```sql
SELECT
  lr.room_name,
  lr.room_sid,
  lr.status,
  s.title
FROM livekit_rooms lr
JOIN sessions s ON lr.session_id = s.id
WHERE lr.session_id = '44fa27d7-0528-46ce-9648-810539c2555c';
```

**Expected:** `room_sid` should now be populated (format: `RM_xxxxx`)

### ✅ LiveKit Server Check:
```bash
# SSH into Oracle VM
ssh -i ./ssh-key-2025-09-14.key ubuntu@140.245.251.150

# Check LiveKit server logs
sudo journalctl -u livekit -n 100

# Should show room creation:
# "room created" name="session-44fa27d7-0528-46ce-9648-810539c2555c"
```

### ✅ API Test:
```bash
curl "http://140.245.251.150:7880/rtc/validate?access_token=YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Before fix:** `{"error":"requested room does not exist"}`
**After fix:** `{"success":true}` or similar success response

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### New Booking Flow:

```
1. User creates booking
   ↓
2. POST /api/bookings
   ↓
3. Session record created in DB
   ↓
4. LiveKitRoomManager.createRoomForSession() called:
   ├─ STEP 1: Call LiveKit API → Create room on server
   ├─ STEP 2: Insert record in livekit_rooms table (with room_sid)
   ├─ STEP 3: Create participant records
   └─ STEP 4: Log event
   ↓
5. Session.meeting_url updated
   ↓
6. Notifications sent to mentor & mentee
```

### User Joins Meeting Flow:

```
1. User navigates to /meeting/{sessionId}
   ↓
2. Server validates: Auth, Participant, Time window, Room exists
   ↓
3. MeetingRoom component loads
   ↓
4. Fetch access token: GET /api/sessions/{id}/livekit/access-token
   ↓
5. LiveKitRoomManager.generateAccessToken():
   ├─ Validate user is participant
   ├─ Generate JWT with room name
   └─ Return token + wsUrl
   ↓
6. LiveKitRoom connects to server with token
   ↓
7. LiveKit server validates token and checks room EXISTS ✅
   ↓
8. Video call established successfully
```

## 🛡️ Safeguards Added

1. **Two-Phase Creation:**
   - LiveKit room created first
   - Database record created second
   - If DB fails, LiveKit room is deleted automatically

2. **Orphan Prevention:**
   - Cleanup logic deletes LiveKit room if DB insert fails
   - Manual cleanup logged if automated cleanup fails

3. **Enhanced Logging:**
   - Every step logged with detailed context
   - Errors include full stack traces
   - Critical failures flagged for manual intervention

4. **SID Storage:**
   - LiveKit server-assigned SID now stored in `room_sid` column
   - Enables direct room lookups on LiveKit server
   - Useful for debugging and monitoring

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Connection Test
```bash
tsx scripts/test-livekit-connection.ts
```
**Verifies:** LiveKit server connectivity and API credentials

### Test 2: Fix Existing Rooms
```bash
tsx scripts/fix-existing-rooms.ts
```
**Verifies:** Can create rooms for existing DB records

### Test 3: End-to-End Test
1. Create new booking
2. Access meeting page
3. Join meeting
4. Verify video/audio works

**All tests must pass before deploying to production.**

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment

1. ✅ Run connection test
2. ✅ Run room repair script
3. ✅ Verify existing sessions work
4. ✅ Test new booking creation
5. ✅ Monitor logs for 24 hours
6. ✅ Check for any orphaned rooms

## 📝 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to create room on LiveKit server"

**Check:**

### Issue: "Database creation failed"

**Check:**
- PostgreSQL running and accessible
- Database connection string in `.env.local`
- `livekit_rooms` table exists: `\dt livekit*`

**Check:**
- Token includes correct room name
- `room_sid` populated in database
- LiveKit server has matching room (check with `listRooms()`)
