## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **Test 1: Pre-Join Screen Display**

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Create a session booking** (or use existing session)

3. **Access meeting URL** as mentor or mentee:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/meeting/{session-id}
   ```

     - ✅ Preview works BEFORE joining meeting

2. **Toggle video off:**

2. **Toggle microphone off:**
   - Click microphone icon/toggle
   - ✅ Mic muted
   - ✅ Icon shows mic is off

3. **Toggle microphone back on:**
   - Click microphone icon/toggle again
   - ✅ Mic unmuted

### **Test 5: Join Meeting Flow**

2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - ✅ Button click triggers connection
   - ✅ Screen transitions to full meeting UI
   - ✅ Connection established to LiveKit server
   - ✅ You join the room
   - ✅ Your video/audio settings from pre-join are applied

3. **Verify in meeting:**
   - ✅ Header shows session title

   - ✅ Your video/audio state matches pre-join choices
   - ✅ Controls work (mute, camera off, etc.)

---

### **Test 6: Two Participants**

**Setup:** Need 2 browsers (or devices)

1. **Browser 1 (Mentor):**
   - Access meeting URL
   - See pre-join screen
   - Click "Join Meeting"
   - ✅ Enters meeting alone (waiting for mentee)

2. **Browser 2 (Mentee):**
   - Access same meeting URL
   - See pre-join screen
   - Preview shows their camera
   - Click "Join Meeting"
   - ✅ Joins the meeting

3. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Both participants see each other
   - ✅ Both can see/hear each other
   - ✅ Participant count shows "2 participants"

---

### **Test 7: Error Handling**

**Test 7A: Camera Permission Denied**
1. Access meeting
2. Deny camera permission when prompted
3. **Expected:**
   - ✅ Preview shows error/placeholder
   - ✅ Can still join meeting (audio only)
   - ✅ "Join Meeting" button still works

**Test 7B: Network Issues**
1. Disconnect network after pre-join loads
2. Click "Join Meeting"
3. **Expected:**
   - ✅ Connection error displayed
   - ✅ Retry button available
   - ✅ Error message is clear

---

### **Test 8: Backward Compatibility**

1. **Verify existing features still work:**
   - ✅ Authorization checks (unauthorized users blocked)
   - ✅ Time window checks (too early/late)
   - ✅ Session validation
   - ✅ Room validation
   - ✅ Token generation
   - ✅ Database logging
   - ✅ Leave meeting functionality

2. **Check database:**
   ```sql
   -- Participant status should still update correctly
   SELECT
     participant_status,
     joined_at,
     left_at
   FROM livekit_participants
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```
   - ✅ Status changes: invited → joined → left
   - ✅ Timestamps populated correctly

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your implementation is successful if:

- ✅ **Pre-join screen displays before joining**

- ✅ **Can toggle video/audio before joining**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Pre-join screen doesn't show camera

**Possible Causes:**
1. Camera permission denied
2. Camera in use by another app
3. No camera available

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for permission errors
- Close other apps using camera
- Try different camera from dropdown

### Issue: "Join Meeting" button doesn't work

**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Username field is filled (required)
3. Network connectivity

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Check console for:
"✅ User ready to join meeting with choices:"
// This confirms button click is registered
```

### Issue: Immediately connects without pre-join

**Check:**
1. Verify `hasJoined` state is initially `false`
2. Verify `connect={hasJoined}` in LiveKitRoom component
3. Clear browser cache and reload

## 📊 Implementation Details

### **State Management:**

```typescript
// Controls pre-join visibility
const [hasJoined, setHasJoined] = useState(false);

// Stores user choices from pre-join
const [userChoices, setUserChoices] = useState<LocalUserChoices>({
  username: '',
  videoEnabled: true,
  audioEnabled: true,
});
```

### **Flow Control:**

```typescript
// Pre-join shown when:
!hasJoined && !isLoading && !error

// Meeting shown when:
hasJoined && !isLoading && !error

// Connection happens when:
hasJoined === true
```

### **Props Applied:**

From pre-join to LiveKitRoom:
- ✅ `videoEnabled` → Camera state
- ✅ `audioEnabled` → Microphone state
- ✅ `username` → Participant display name
