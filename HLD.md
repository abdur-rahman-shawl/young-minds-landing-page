# High-Level Design (HLD) - YoungMinds Platform

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the architecture and design of the YoungMinds platform. YoungMinds is a comprehensive mentor-mentee connect platform that allows mentors to create and sell courses, and mentees to enroll in those courses and connect with mentors for one-on-one sessions.

The platform is designed to be a complete solution for online learning and mentorship, with features such as user management, course creation, booking and scheduling, messaging, and learning analytics.

## 2. Architecture

The YoungMinds platform is built using a modern, full-stack architecture with a Next.js frontend and a backend powered by serverless functions.

*   **Frontend:** The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with Next.js and React. It uses Tailwind CSS and Radix UI for styling and UI components.
*   **Backend:** The backend is implemented as a set of serverless functions co-located with the frontend in the `app/api` directory. These functions handle all the business logic, database interactions, and communication with external services.
*   **Database:** The platform uses a PostgreSQL database to store all its data. Drizzle ORM is used to interact with the database and manage the schema.
*   **Authentication:** Authentication is handled by the `better-auth` library, which provides a complete solution for user authentication, including email/password and OAuth providers.

## 3. Technologies Used

*   **Framework:** Next.js
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **ORM:** Drizzle ORM
*   **Authentication:** better-auth, @supabase/supabase-js
*   **UI:** React, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Shadcn UI
*   **Form Management:** react-hook-form
*   **Data Fetching:** @tanstack/react-query, swr
*   **AI:** @ai-sdk/google, @google/generative-ai
*   **Scheduling:** date-fns, react-day-picker
*   **Language:** TypeScript

## 4. Data Model

The database schema is well-structured and comprehensive, with a number of tables to support the platform's features. The main data entities are:

*   **Users:** Stores user information, including their profile, roles, and authentication details.
*   **Roles:** Defines the different roles in the system (admin, mentor, mentee).
*   **Mentors:** Stores detailed information about mentors, including their professional background, expertise, and availability.
*   **Mentees:** Stores information about mentees, including their goals, interests, and learning preferences.
*   **Courses:** Represents the courses created by mentors, including modules, sections, and content.
*   **Course Enrollments:** Tracks the enrollment of mentees in courses and their progress.
*   **Sessions:** Represents the one-on-one sessions between mentors and mentees.
*   **Messages:** Stores the messages exchanged between users.
*   **Notifications:** Stores notifications for users.
*   **Reviews:** Stores reviews and ratings for sessions and courses.
*   **Learning Analytics:** A sophisticated analytics system to track learning progress, engagement, and provide insights.
*   **AI Chatbot:** An AI-powered chatbot for user assistance.

## 5. Core Features

### 5.1. User Management and Authentication

*   Users can sign up and log in using their email and password or through OAuth providers.
*   The system supports three user roles: admin, mentor, and mentee.
*   Admins have full control over the platform and can manage users, courses, and other settings.

### 5.2. Mentor and Mentee Profiles

*   Mentors can create detailed profiles with information about their professional background, expertise, and availability.
*   Mentees can create profiles with their learning goals, interests, and preferences.

### 5.3. Course Management

*   Mentors can create and manage courses with a rich content editor.
*   Courses can be organized into modules and sections.
*   Content can be in various formats, including video, PDF, text, and external URLs.

### 5.4. Booking and Scheduling

*   Mentors can set their availability for one-on-one sessions.
*   Mentees can book sessions with mentors based on their availability.
*   The system handles the scheduling and sends reminders to both mentors and mentees.

### 5.5. Messaging

*   The platform includes a real-time messaging system for one-on-one conversations between users.
*   The messaging system supports text, images, and file attachments.

### 5.6. Notifications

### 5.7. Reviews and Ratings

*   Mentees can rate and review the courses they have completed and the sessions they have attended.
*   Mentors can also rate their sessions with mentees.

### 5.8. Learning Analytics

*   The platform tracks the learning progress of mentees and provides detailed analytics to both mentees and mentors.
*   This helps mentees to stay on track with their learning goals and mentors to understand the effectiveness of their courses.

### 5.9. AI Chatbot

*   An AI-powered chatbot is available to assist users with their queries and provide support.

## 6. API Endpoints

The backend API is organized into a set of serverless functions in the `app/api` directory. The API is well-structured, with each feature having its own subdirectory. For example, the API endpoints for user management are located in `app/api/user`, and the endpoints for course management are in `app/api/courses`.
